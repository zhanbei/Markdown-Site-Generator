# The Default and Built-in Configures

<!-- > 2018-11-20T02:05:24+0800 -->

The built-in configures used as the default configures when initializing sites.

The `index.js` and `github` are copied directly from `.site_configs` (a submodule of [Markdown-Site-Configs](https://github.com/zhanbei/.markdown-site-configs));
the `diff-from-site-configs.sh` checks the differences.

The `index.js` is the entrance of the configures while the `github` is the theme selected.
